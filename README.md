# Tetris
"Poor predictable Vule. Always makes Tetris."
"Good ol' Tetris. Nothing beats that!"
Move tetromino with arrow keys (left, right, down) and rotate it with arrow up.
Tetrominos start falling faster every 25 blocks, up to maximum of double starting speed.
You get 25 points for every tetromino and 150 per line cleared.
